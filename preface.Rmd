To state the good I found there, I'll also say what else I saw.

Having abandoned the true way, I fell into a deep sleep and awoke in a deep dark wood. I set out to escape the wood, but my path was blocked by a lion. As I fled to lower ground, a figure appeared before me. "Have mercy on me, whatever you are," I cried, "whether shade or living human."

"Not a man, though once I was. My parents were from Lombardy. I was born sub Julio and lived in Rome in an age of false and lying gods."

"Are you Virgil, the fountainhead of such a volume?"

"I think it wise you follow me. I will lead you through an eternal place where you shall hear despairing cries and see those ancient souls in pain as they grieve their second death."

After a journey, we arrived at an archway. Inscribed on it: "Through me the way into the suffering city, through me the way among the lost". Through the archway we went.Now sighing and wails resounded through the starless air, so that I too began weeping. Unfamiliar tongues, horrendous accents, cries of rage all of these whirled in that dark and timeless air.
