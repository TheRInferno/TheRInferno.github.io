## Unhelpfully Seeking Advice 
Here live the thieves, guarded by the centaur Cacus. The inhabitants are bitten
by lizards and snakes.  
  
There’s a special place for those who—not being content with one of the 8
Circles we’ve already visited—feel compelled to drag the rest of us into hell.
The road to writing a mail message should include at least the following
stops:  
  
## 9.1 Read the appropriate documentation  
“RTFM” in the jargon. There is a large amount of documentation about R, both
official and contributed, and in various formats. A large amount of documentation
means that it is often nontrivial to find what you are looking for—especially
when frustration is setting in and blood pressure is rising.  
  
**Breathe**  

There are various searches that you can do. R functions for searching include `help.search`, `RSiteSearch`, and `apropos`. 
  
If you are looking for particular functionality, then check the Task Views (found on the left-side menu of CRAN).  
  
If you have an error, then look in rather than out—debug the problem.  
  
One way of debugging is to set the error option, and then use the debugger function:  
  
```
options(error=dump.frames)
# command that causes the error
debugger()
```
The debugger function then provides a menu of the stack of functions that have
been called at the point of the error. You can inspect the state of the objects
inside these functions, and hopefully understand what the problem is.

As Virgil said to me, “I’m pleased with all your questions, but one of them might have found its answer when you saw the red stream boiling.”
